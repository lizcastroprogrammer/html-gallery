/*
display: flex changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.
display: inline-flex allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other.
justify-content is used to space items along the main axis.
align-items is used to space items along the cross axis.
flex-grow is used to specify how much space (and in what proportions) flex items absorb along the main axis.
flex-shrink is used to specify how much flex items shrink and in what proportions along the main axis.
flex-basis is used to specify the initial size of an element styled with flex-grow and/or flex-shrink.
flex is used to specify flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis in one declaration.
flex-wrap specifies that elements should shift along the cross axis if the flex container is not large enough.
align-content is used to space rows along the cross axis.
flex-direction is used to specify the main and cross axes.
flex-flow is used to specify flex-wrap and flex-direction in one declaration.
Flex containers can be nested inside of each other by declaring display: flex or display: inline-flex for children of flex containers.
